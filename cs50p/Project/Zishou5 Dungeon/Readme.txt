Text-Based Dungeon

A beginner-friendly text-based dungeon game built in Python.
This is my first real project: a place where I learned how to think, break problems down, and solve them one by one.

About This Project:

I built this dungeon as a self-taught developer to practice real programming, not theory.
Every room, every path, and every combat loop represents a bug I had to fight, a concept I had to learn, or a wall I had to break through.
This project helped me understand:
How real programs need structure
How small problems connect to create a system
How to make code scale instead of hardcoding everything
How to debug, rethink, and rebuild features until they work
It started as a simple “type A or B” script.
Now it’s a small engine.

How to Run:
python main.py

Requirements:
Python 3.10+
A terminal (Windows / macOS / Linux)

Gameplay Features:

- Choose between multiple rooms, paths, routes, and endings
- Branching story with consequences
- Turn-based combat
- Retry system for battles and game over sequences

Technical Features:

These are the systems I implemented while learning Python:
Navigation System
Dictionary-based dungeon layout
Each room has a path, state, and function
Progressive flag system
One engine (game()) that controls all rooms
Combat System
Turn-based logic
Dynamic enemy creation using .copy()
Scalable enemy count (single or multiple enemies)
Enemy selection using enumerate()
Player class behavior differences
Health, mana, skills, and effects
Dialogue & Choice System
Branching dialogue with different consequences
Hidden options and joke choices

What I Learned:
This project taught me real Python fundamentals, including:

- Loops (nested, conditional, and flow control)
- Dictionaries and mutable state
- Copying objects properly
- Breaking logic into functions
- Using lists to scale instead of hardcoding
- Error handling (basic try/except, experimental ideas)
- Designing systems instead of writing random code
- Tracing bugs and fixing messy logic
- Writing code that can grow without rewriting everything


Most importantly:
I learned how to think like a developer.

Roadmap

Upcoming improvements:

Fully polished multi-enemy combat
- Items and loot tables
- Exception-based hidden route (“the chained child”)
- Cleaner structure and refactor pass

Disclaimer
This is my first real project.
The code is messy in some places, experimental in others, and still growing — but it represents my actual learning progress day by day.

I’m improving it constantly, and I’ll leave the history as-is to show my growth.
